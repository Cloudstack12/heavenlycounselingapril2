                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Christian mental health counseling is a form of counseling that integrates Christian faith and principles with evidence-based psychological techniques to address mental health issues. It combines traditional therapeutic approaches with Christian beliefs and values to help individuals find healing, growth, and meaning. Christian mental health counselors may use prayer, scripture, and other spiritual practices as part of their therapy sessions, in addition to conventional counseling techniques such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, psychodynamic therapy, and interpersonal therapy. Christian mental health counseling aims to help individuals develop a deeper understanding of themselves and their relationship with God and provide them with the tools and support they need to overcome mental health challenges and achieve emotional and spiritual well-being.
